Codeplugs for the Ailunce HD1 DMR Radio

These are codeplugs for the Ailunce HD1 DMR radio I have colleceted from across the internet.  They are free to download but use at your own risk.

I am NOT responsible if they brick your HT.  I have not had any issues with any of them but again, use at your own risk.
